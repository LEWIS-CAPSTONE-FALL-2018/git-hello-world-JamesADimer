Welcome!

In the is readMe file, I will walk you through the steps to executing 
my assignment1.cpp 

This file prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

The first thing you need in order to run this file is a C++ compiler.
If you already have Microsoft Visual Studio, you already have this tool at your disposal,
just click on the "tools" folder and click on "Developer Command Prompt".

In this command prompt, you're going to want to change your directory to the folder
where the *.cpp you are running is located and use the following command to compile:

cl <filename>.cpp

Now that the *.cpp file is compiled, you may now execute the file through the command:

<filename>.cpp

This should run the compiled executable. If you replace the <filename> with "assignment1",
you should see the message "Hello, World!" pop up on the command line.
